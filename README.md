## Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy Detection is a project aimed at identifying and classifying diabetic retinopathy in retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes that affects the eyes and can lead to blindness if not detected and treated early. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze retinal images and identify signs of diabetic retinopathy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of retinal images labeled with diabetic retinopathy severity levels. It includes images of varying quality and resolution obtained from different sources. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets for model development and evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Setup
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn
```

Download the dataset and organize it into appropriate directories as specified in the code.

## Training

To train the model, run the training script with the appropriate parameters. Adjust hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs as needed for optimal performance.

## Evaluation

After training the model, evaluate its performance on the test set using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualize the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves to assess the model's performance.

## Results

Summarize the results of the model evaluation, including its accuracy and performance metrics. Discuss any limitations or challenges encountered during the project and potential areas for improvement.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please open an issue or submit a pull request with your suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes.
